# Tetris Pong

## Introduction:

As part of an OOP in C++ course (2nd year) we were given a task to teach us different elements:
- Working with classes and structs. 
- Inheritance and polymorphism.
- Working in a team.
- Implemention several design patterns.

## Our project:
The game is a combination of two well-known games Tetris and Pong.  
this "tennis like" game features two board and a ball, the purpose is that your opponent will miss the ball.  
Once one of the players misses the ball, a dead board from the real board falls to his side and the board approaches one step to the middle.  
If you manage to create a perfect column from the dead boards like in Tetris game, the column disappears and the real board goes one step back.  
In addition, each player can change the ball to a bomb mode, and if the board touches the bomb, the borad approaches three steps to the middle.

The goal is to battle your opponent up to a quarter of the screen. Once you did it, you won!

 ## Settings
 - Make sure before you start to play that the size of the console screen is 80/25.
